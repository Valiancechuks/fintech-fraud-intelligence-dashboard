# Fintech Fraud Intelligence Dashboard

# Machine-Learning-Assisted Transaction Risk Analytics using Power BI


# Project Overview

This project simulates real-world fintech payment transactions and builds a fraud intelligence dashboard to monitor transaction performance, fraud exposure, and operational risk drivers across countries, payment channels, and merchant categories.

The solution combines:

Clean, realistic transaction data

Feature engineering grounded in fraud behavior

Machine-learning-assisted risk signals

An executive-ready Power BI single-page dashboard

The dataset is fully synthetic and safe for public sharing.


# Business Problem

Fintech platforms face persistent challenges such as:

Rising fraud risk as transaction volume scales

Card and merchant-based fraud concentration

Country-specific transaction behavior

Limited visibility into emerging risk trends

This project demonstrates how analytics and risk intelligence can be used to proactively monitor and manage transaction risk.


# Solution Approach

Generated a clean synthetic dataset (10,000+ transactions)

Engineered behavioral and risk-based features

Created pseudo-labeled fraud indicators

Trained an explainable Random Forest model

Integrated fraud signals into Power BI

Delivered a single-page fintech fraud intelligence dashboard


# Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SHAP)

Power BI (DAX, Modeling, Power Query)

Machine Learning (Random Forest, Pseudo-Labeling)

Data Analytics (EDA, Feature Engineering)

Visualization (Executive-level dashboards)


# Dashboard Preview

The dashboard provides a high-level fraud overview while allowing drill-downs by country, payment method, merchant category, and time.


# Key Insights

Fraud incidence remains below 10% but trends upward over time

Non-card-based transactions dominate volume.

Airtime/Data and Bill payment categories show a higher risk

Fraud exposure varies slightly by country

Recent years show accelerated fraud growth


# Business Recommendations

Apply dynamic fraud thresholds by country

Strengthen controls on card and POS channels

Monitor high-risk merchant categories proactively

Use ML-assisted risk scoring for early detection

Maintain executive-level fraud dashboards for leadership
